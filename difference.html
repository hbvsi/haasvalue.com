<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too often, business valuations are done mechanically, essentially by formula, with no insight by the appraiser.&nbsp; We don't work this way.&nbsp; Instead, we focus on finding the missing numbers, the hidden transaction, the absent piece of that complex puzzle upon which many business valuations center -- and we do this in a manner that is supportable in a court of law or before the Internal Revenue Service.&nbsp; In other words, we "get it right."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These twin aims -- getting behind the numbers and producing legally credible work -- set us apart from our competitors.&nbsp; In fact, they define the Haas Business Valuation Services difference.&nbsp; That difference, in turn, stems from the broad background of R. Victor Haas, Jr., President and Founder.&nbsp; Both CPA and business valuation expert, Haas holds an MBA from the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania.&nbsp; He has worked with one of the "Big 6" accounting firms and for a large Philadelphia bank where he sold closely-held businesses and provided their financing.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is this dual foundation of "real world" pragmatism and analytic academics that gives Haas Business Valuation Services its creative, problem-solving orientation.&nbsp; And, quite frankly, solving the problem -- the investigative aspect of valuation -- is something few firms are either eager or able to undertake.&nbsp; We, however, enjoy this part of business valuation services and do it efficiently and effectively.&nbsp; Haas and his associates have authored several hundred reports, many of which have been the basis of expert testimony.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good business valuation is not the application of routine accounting principles.&nbsp; Rather, it is the engagement of the principles of corporate finance:&nbsp; understanding the underlying investment risks and rewards of each business we are asked to value.&nbsp; It also entails a solid grounding in those approaches to valuation which are used in the courtroom, before the IRS, and in the marketplace.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what our clients have come to expect from us:&nbsp; timely, credible, and competent business valuations and accounting services from one source which can, if necessary, stand up under the scrutiny of courtroom cross-examination.&nbsp; And our established track record proves clients can expect efficient work for a reasonable fee, delivered in a timely manner, by a team of proactive, litigation-savvy professionals.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cost-effective, reliable results that work -- the Haas Business Valuation Services difference.</P>
